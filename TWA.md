#### Handling Disagreements and Conflict Resolution
1. Addressing Conflicts:
Conflicts should be brought up as early as possible in an open and respectful manner.
We will first attempt to resolve disagreements within the team through discussion and understanding.
If the conflict cannot be resolved, the Scrum Master will mediate to help facilitate a resolution.
In the event of persistent conflicts, escalate to the TA or Professor (usually for non-product related things)
2. Guidelines for Handling Disagreements:
Focus on the problem, not the person.
Listen actively to each other's perspectives.
Propose solutions that are collaborative, aiming for win-win outcomes.
7. Handling Feedback
Constructive Feedback:
Feedback should focus on specific actions, not generalize about a person’s abilities or behaviors.
Regular feedback will be provided in code reviews, retrospectives, and sprint reviews.
Feedback should be timely—address issues as soon as possible to ensure continuous improvement.


#### Definition of Done (DoD)
A feature or task will be considered “Done” when:

1. The code has been written, reviewed by at least one peer, and merged into the main branch.
Unit tests have been written and passed.
2. Integration tests, where applicable, have been implemented and passed.
3. Code is deployed to the staging environment and validated.
4. Documentation (technical and user-facing) has been updated accordingly.
5. The feature has been reviewed by the Scrum Master and Product Owner and meets the defined acceptance criteria.
6. Any required deployments have been made to production (if applicable).
7. There are no outstanding critical bugs/issues.

#### Documentation And Artifacts:

2. Github Projects will track task progress and bug fixes.
3. The GitHub repository will house code, pull requests, and version control.

#### Work Hours:
Team members are expected to be advertise their schedule and generally available for communication during hours mentioned in the schedule. If someone has flexible working hours, they must inform the team.

1. Respect: Every team member’s input is valuable. We will maintain a respectful tone in all communication, both verbal and written. All feedback will be constructive.
2. Openness: We will maintain transparency in our work, challenges, and progress. Everyone should feel comfortable sharing updates, blockers, or concerns without fear of judgment.
